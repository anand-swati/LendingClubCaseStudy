# Lending Club Case Study
> This project uses EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

  Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 

  In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 

  If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

## General Information
- This project uses EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
- Dataset used: Loan dataset

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
1.	Fully paid loans are more than charged off loans.
2.	The most of the loans chraged off were taken for the purpose of debt_consolidation.
3.	Most of the loans defaulted were with interest rate in the range 9-13
4.	Applicants who have applied for larger loan amounts have taken long term loans
5.	Charged off is more in case of mortgage
